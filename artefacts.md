This abstract/ project uses innovative mapping tools to present and elaborate networks resulting from ongoing research at the intersection of the history of ideas and movement of intellectuals in a given period. Appropriating historians’ ‘moving localities’ which considers what moves with an individual, the project demonstrates how the Enlightenment benefitted from a borderless process of knowledge formation.

Focussing on Greek speaking intellectual's mobility in the Ottoman Empire during the 17th-18th century and the resulting contribution to knowledge formation also supports a reconsideration of the relationship between center and periphery. The scope of this intellectual network and scholars hopes to encourage and aid historians with a just inclusion of such intellectuals in histories of the Enlightenment’s knowledge formation process. From a technical standpoint the project does not aim to be ‘concluded’ definitely, but to leave an expandable resource open to the contribution of future scholars.

Considering Danah Boyd’s argument regarding the problematic assumption that age sanctions an individual’s technological expertise, Hoover underlines the access limitations which can do so. Digital innovation has not been able to bypass the social divisions imposed by wealth and this demonstrates that limitations of access are not necessarily related to knowledge of such tools.

Hoover also reports on the consolidation of the resulting ‘digital divide’ due to the diverse length and available resources between community colleges and four year institutional programs. As Hoover notes, while some students eventually join four year institutional programs gaining equal accessibility, the ‘score’ is not settled for students of different ages who are limited to the community college. 

Focussing on the ‘digital divide’ identified at the community college level, Hoover proposes ways to address the issues at hand.

Gephi is an open-source graphing and networking platform. The software is easily downloadable online at no cost to the user and is operable on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux systems. 

The “Features” page of gephi.org describes the software’s capacities combining text with visual examples. The aesthetic possibilities, which are certainly a major selling point for the platform are further emphasised in the “Videos” and “Screenshots” pages. Gephi users can bring the data of a traditional curve, pie graph or network map to life. The possibility to not only choose colours but also the shades of each one nearly allows the user to dedicate as much attention to the aesthetics as to the data represented in the graph or networks. Perhaps the most effective way to describe Gephi is to cite a quote on their home page which reads: “Like Photoshop™ for graphs” attributed to the community (gephi.org).
